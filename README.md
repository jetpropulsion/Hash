# Hash
Simple hashing algorithms and partial reimplementation in assembly language
This is eight years old code, so accept that things are changed and modify it accordingly, if really needed.
Names of the hashing algorithms correspond to their original form, as found on the respective authors' sites.

NOTE: This is Microsoft preferred "C++" style as found in their code examples, in fact closer to pure C

Algorithms covered:

1. Simple sum of octets read
2. Murmur (and x86 reimplementation)
3. Jenkins (and x86 reimplementation)
4. DJB2 (and x86 reimplementation)
5. SDBM
6. Rotating
7. EMACS
8. PJW
9. AVL
10. CRC32 (and x86 reimplementation)
11. FNV1a (and x86 reimplementation)
